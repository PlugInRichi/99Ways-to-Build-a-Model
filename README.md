# 99 Ways to Build a Model

_99 Ways to tell a story_ it's a book written by Matt Madden's (inspired by Raymond Queneau's at the same time) that collects a series of short comics
that tell the same history in a variety of ways. Just like in literature it's possible to tell a story in so many different ways, in the field of Machine 
Learning there is a wide variety of algorithms to solve the same problem.

I hope this repository can help you to stimulate your creativity and inspire you to create new solutions that until now nobody has imagined. :sparkles:
